    <p>
        Due to legal restrictions, I am unable to share visuals of the systems developed.<br>

    <h2>Initially a brand intiative, I realized early on our problem was twofold.</h2>
    <p>We need to design education materials that resonate with high school students, while staying within government-affiliated nonprofit constraints.</p>
    <p>We also need to equip non-technical stakeholders with the tools to independently create for and run their workshops without relying on additional team members.</p>
    <p>While the rest of the team tackled branding, I owned system development.</p>

    <h2>My goal was to develop an intuitive system around accessibility and ease-of-use.</h2>
    <p>
        I worked with EndoFound to rebuild critical touchpoints within their existing systems, allowing me to stress-test directly with the people who would be using the systems every day.

    <h2>I delivered a practical toolkit, reducing the technical barriers to execution.</h2>
    <p>Stakeholders were free to focus on fulfilling ENPOWR's core mission: educating students and fostering self-advocacy.</p>
