        <span class="newsreader">Reduce headache?</span>&emsp;&mdash;&emsp;A bit of context.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <span class="newsreader" style="font-size:2rem; line-height:150%;">You don't need more software. You need less.</span>
</section>

<section>
    <p>Guided by core missions, founders are constantly solving problems. Once funding hits, those core missions become susceptible to shiny object syndrome. Suddenly, every new tool looks like a solution to optimize operations just a bit more.</p>
    <p>A new CRM, a bit more automation, perfectly-designed dashboards. You blink, and suddenly your life's mission is being run by a Rube Goldberg machine nobody actually knows how to use.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The cost isn't the monthly software bill.</h2>
    <p>
        It's the hours your team spends navigating overlapping systems. The friction in your workflows. The momentum lost in maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's the quiet defeat, <span class="newsreader">this is just how startups are</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>What if it doesn't have to be this way?</h2>
    <p>
        I design <span class="newsreader">underengineered systems</span>&mdash;lean, intuitive frameworks that grow with you, not against you.
    </p>
    <p>
        We start by stripping your operations down to their essentials. Then, we rebuild with intention, using only what drives clarity, speed, and alignment across your team.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Your company starts moving again.</h2>
    <p>
        Freed from the shackles of the Rube Goldberg machine, your team spends time building towards the mission, not endlessly wrangling their tools back into place.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your systems finally feel like they were built <span class="newsreader">for</span> you, not <span class="newsreader">forced</span> on you.
    </p>

    <h2>It's time to cut the noise.</h2>
    <p>
        If your workspace feels bloated, confusing, just plain overcomplicated, or your team feels bogged down, it's time to find the signal hiding in the static.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll help you re-engineer your setup around what actually matters: the mission that brought you here in the first place.

        <span class="newsreader">FAQs</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>What do you mean by <span class="newsreader">underengineered systems</span>?</span><br>
        <span class="details">
            It means stripping away unnecessary tools and automations to lean, intuitive systems that serve your core business functions&mdash;nothing more, nothing less.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>What kinds of tools do you work with?</span><br>
        <span class="details">
            The ones you're using: Airtable, Notion, Zapier, Google Workspace, and other modern SaaS platforms. That said, the focus isn't on <span class="newsreader">specific software</span>, it's on how your systems <span class="newsreader">work together</span>.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>Are you just cleaning things up, or rebuilding from scratch?</span><br>
        <span class="details">
            Usually, it's both. I work with your team to audit what you have, decide what's worth keeping, and rebuild the rest around simpler, more functional frameworks.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>How do you decide what to keep and what to cut?</span><br>
        <span class="details">
            Working directly with your team to understand what's actually used, what's ignored, and what's slowing people down. Data, workflows, and real habits drive the decisions, not assumptions.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>My company is still small, do I need this yet?</span><br>
        <span class="details">
            Absolutely. Early-stage is the <span class="newsreader">best time</span>. Building lean, scalable systems before things have a chance to get messy saves time and money down the road.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>Do you handle implementation, or just strategy?</span><br>
        <span class="details">
            Both. I design the framework, document the logic, and help your team implement it so it becomes part of your daily workflow&mdash;not another plan that sits on a shelf.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>How long does a typical re-engineering take?</span><br>
        <span class="details">
            Depends on complexity and team size. For larger teams, I prefer working with you for a full quarter, but smaller teams can be as little as 6 weeks.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>How do you measure success?</span><br>
        <span class="details">
            Less friction, fewer tools, faster workflows, and teams who actually <span class="newsreader">enjoy</span> the system. I often track time saved per task or reduction in redundant tools as benchmarks.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>We just bought a ton of software. Can you work with that?</span><br>
        <span class="details">
            Absolutely. The goal isn’t to throw everything out&mdash;it's to make sure every tool you keep has a clear purpose and earns its place in your stack.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>What's the first step?</span><br>
        <span class="details">
            Start with a short consult. We'll talk through your current setup, identify immediate friction points, and outline what a simplified system could look like for your team.
