        <span class="newsreader">I'm writing this on my 25th birthday.</span> Coffee's brewing, the new iteration of my portfolio's shipped, and I'm starting my 'blog' fresh on Substack this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a few more clicks, I'll be entirely in this new era of self. It feels good to embrace fresh starts. I find it opens doors to new knowledge and opportunities I wouldn't have otherwise looked for.

        I've consciously chosen to fill my time with more things I love. Loved ones not included, these are the activities I've been finding the most enjoyment from:
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&mdash;&emsp;<span class="newsreader">Learning languages</span><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&mdash;&emsp;<span class="newsreader">Physical training</span><br>

    <h2>Ignoring Tahoe</h2>
    <p>
        I love keeping my devices updated, but I can't get past how terrible liquid glass looks. I'm fully embedded in the Apple ecosystem, so I'll be staying behind on updates for the foreseeable future.
        It's disappointing to watch the downfall of Apple's design language. Aside from my iPhone 14, the rest of my devices are from 2019. I know I'll need to replace them soon, and with the way Apple's been headed, I've been dreading choosing their replacements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Still, I'm locked into the ecosystem, and I love the hardware I have. I'll continue using what I have and keeping the OS out of date until my options look better.

    <h2>Reading the Classics</h2>
    <p>
        I've been spending a lot of time working through my TBR list, and <span class="newsreader"><a href="https://literal.club/hayleyjolliffe" target="_blank">documenting on Literal</a></span> when I remember to.
        I recently came across a <span class="newsreader"><a href="https://youtu.be/yfQAnBol6Jw" target="_blank">PewDiePie video</a></span>, wherein he starts a book club. I found that the bulk of his book club reads for the year
        were also on my TBR list, so it felt like a good opportunity to tackle them despite finding the video this late in the year.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'd like to finish these by the end of the year:

    <h2>Taking on Deep Blue</h2>
    <p>
        Growing up, I played chess with a group of friends over rainy lunch breaks. We had fun, and were good enough to qualify for a local chess tournament. We beat some local private school kids, but it wasn't something we took very seriously. It was just fun.
    </p>
    <p>Semi-recently, Duolingo launched their chess course, and I decided to reconnect with the game. I already use Duolingo to learn Polish and German, so why not learn a bit more about chess?</p>
    <p>
        I don't expect to be <span class="newsreader">Deep Blue</span> good, and I have no idea how the ELO system works, but I do know this: In two weeks, I've solidly established myself in the 620-650 range, and it's curbed my doomscrolling habit. I can't imagine that's an impressive score, but I'm happy with my results.
