    <h2>As client and team volumes multiplied, so did inefficiencies.</h2>
    <p>
        Internal systems hadn't been built to support this scale. Outdated information and inconsistent access made miscommunication and data fracturing far more frequent.

    <h2>Our goal was to establish frictionless collaboration as our system's core.</h2>
    <p>
        We needed to eliminate redundancies and streamline access to eliminate these friction points. Tracking within live client work ensured all bottlenecks were caught quickly.

    <h2>I decided to stress-test with our non-technical team to ensure all flows were intuitive.</h2>
    <p>Testing frequently to ensure non-technical team members could navigate with ease eliminated need for additional training on rollout. Working within live client work further reduced additional training: everyone&mdash;clients included&mdash;was already using the new systems comfortably.</p>

    <h2>A centralized documentation hub provided consistent access to everyone.</h2>
    <p>Instructions, SOPs, templates, everything in one place, with everyone having access.</p>

    <h2>Drastically reduced errors, slashed handoff time, smoother onboarding for everyone.</h2>
    <p>The overhauled system improved daily efficiency and was praised by leadership and clients for its simplicity and ease-of-use.</p>
