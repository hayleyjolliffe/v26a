For the past few years, I've come up with pithy rules of thumb for every year I've been alive to guide the coming year. I've approached it as a set of dynamic, guiding principles. "24 things for 24", "23 things for 23", and so on.

This year, I'm taking a different approach. As I began thinking, I remembered a feeling from the past few years. It started small, but now it's big enough to recognize: *this is too many things*. I can't focus on 25 large goals and make meaningful progress towards them all.

[Warren Buffett's "Two List" strategy](https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus) uses three steps to determine priorities and actions:

1. Write down your top 25 goals.
2. Review the list and circle your top 5 goals.
3. Circled goals are List A. Uncircled are List B. Avoid List B at all costs until all List A goals are complete.

List B goals, while still important, will only get in the way of completing the most important goals: List A.

I tested Buffett's strategy for myself to see where I was hurting my own goals the most. Turns out, I was casting too wide a net. I was tackling goals from Lists A and B, and wasn't seeing clear progress towards anything. Often, I was confusing motion with action. The bulk of my "actions", were in fact, plain motion. I was destroying my chances of goal achievement without even trying.

When I came back to my list, I noticed something: I felt indifferent towards the majority of my goals. They didn't hold much value, they were placeholder actions until I "can get to something bigger". Their existence was keeping me from my real goals, permanently.

In the end, I came up with something I'm satisfied with. Where Buffett uses this strategy for career goals, my list contains 5 career and 5 personal goals. It's easy to imagine smaller projects that will help me reach each goal. To me, that is far more powerful than only focusing on career. It also prevents me from neglecting self in pursuit of my career goals.

Instead of discarding my principles to fit the tradition, I will keep them. I'll use them to advance towards each of my goals as far as possible. I will not carry conflicting values forward, they keep me away from my goals.

These are the guiding principles I will use to guide me this year:

1. Default to action. (Reminds me not to fall into the *motion* trap, only do enough planning to be able to execute)
2. Be aggressive when your decisions are reversible; be cautious when they are not. (Thanks, [Ramp](https://engineering.ramp.com/post/engineering-principles))
3. Whenever possible, break down projects into small, independent chunks. (Another one from Ramp. Helps me see projects as *steps towards goals*, not independent goals themselves)
4. If it's not helping your goals, it's hurting them. (Keeps me focusing on the core *action* tasks at hand, not the *motion* tasks)
5. Don't outsource your self-worth. (Something of a daily mantra; we are more than our work)

I also reflected on Steph Ango's "40 questions to ask yourself every year" to see where I want to shift my attention moving forward. I've tweaked questions 21 and 31 to fit my birthday as the reflection point.

Question 21, "How are you spending the holidays?" is now "How are you spending your birthday?", and Question 31, "What did you do on your birthday?" is now "What are you planning for this year?"

I noted which questions were most difficult to answer, and why. I'll use those notes to adjust how I approach my days moving forward. I learned a lot about how I was spending my time, and what time I was enjoying. It'll be interesting to see how patterns emerge as I answer the questions on future birthdays.

The biggest thing guiding this new year and new iteration of self is this:

_Embracing constraint, not suffering under restriction._

I'm looking forward to seeing how this year plays out.
