I spent a lot of time in introspection this month, particularly around my birthday. I spent more time reading non-technical materials, and I’ve been enjoying fiction reads.

A few finds of note this month:

## Shop Class As Soulcraft, Matthew B. Crawford
Recommended to me a while back when I mentioned picking up analog hobbies to a friend. I don’t often buy books new, and my local library doesn’t have a copy, so I was happy to finally find a copy secondhand.

Crawford describes the book as a “nestled set of arguments on behalf of work that is meaningful because it is genuinely useful”. I often struggle with the feeling that my work is not “genuinely useful”, so this became a must-read.

Well worth the read, no matter the nature of your work.

## Pushovers Finish Last: Learn to Say No, Lelouch
I fall into what I call the “disguised people-pleasing trap” quite often. I love helping loved ones, and that love often masks how often I agree out of obligation. I’ve read this more than a handful of times, and each time is a reminder to be more conscious of boundary-setting.

## Rooftop Live (Fede’s Roof, Naples), Fred again..
The bulk of my working soundtrack this month has been various DJ sets, primarily Fred again... It was difficult to narrow down for this post, but I have to go with this one.
