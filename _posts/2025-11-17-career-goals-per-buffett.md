1. Get a Master's degree related to software engineering.
2. Become a software engineer that is incredibly good at my craft.
3. Become proficient in at least 3 legacy programming languages:
	1. Assembly
	2. FORTRAN
	3. COBOL
4. Contribute meaningfully to a knowledgeable scientific field in some capacity. Preferably aerospace, psychology, or human body-related; must be beneficial to humanity.
5. Use my blogging/lab notes to become a trusted source of information. Use built trust to fund research and grow as an independent researcher, funding initiatives related to research area(s).
