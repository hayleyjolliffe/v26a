In staying with the current times, it appears all the tools/companies I’d consider to be “classic” spellcheckers have abandoned traditional spellchecking in favour of AI slop editing.

I’ve used Hemingway for years, and I’ve noticed the recommendations now sound disgustingly AI-generated. I retried Grammarly, which I used previously when my school required it, and it’s even worse than Hemingway.

Turns out, “spellchecking” in the AI age is algorithms reading from most commonly used phrasing on the internet, which explains why it’s absolutely godawful. It’s just straight up incorrect. It no longer follows proper grammatical conventions, because human errors are consistent to the point it reads as fact, “everyone” is doing it, so obviously it’s right.

I know there’s a linguistics argument here somewhere, languages naturally evolve and change and the versions we speak now are different even from the versions our grandparents grew up speaking, and so on. I can understand and appreciate that, but we’re replacing perfectly good tools with algorithms that incorrectly interpret “truth” simply because it’s consistent.

I’m likely in an isolated camp for this, but I also despise the trend of writing everything to fit the “most accessible” reading level possible. I’ve noticed many checkers recommend a “6th grade level”, or around what the average 12-year old could easily read. It’s bullshit. I, like many others, possess, and regularly write about technical concepts that the average 12-year old is not well-versed in. Does that mean I should sacrifice the audience I’m actually writing for in favour of the algorithm gods’ hypothetical “ideal reader”? Hell no.

Hypothetical readers aside, I’ve also been an avid user of em dashes and the like, which AI is ruining. Unfortunately for everyone around me, I’m highly capable of yapping incessantly, and I have a solid grasp on punctuation usage. I didn’t get bullied for being a pretentious ass growing up just for AI to nerf my writing style. Developing this style took time, and I’m not abandoning it because computers grew brain cells overnight.

Don’t get me wrong, I love the idea of making my work accessible, but not in a way that neglects who it was intended for or sacrifices my personality. I’m considering picking up Hemingway’s Classic editor, but I’m also open to other alternatives. For the time being, enjoy this non-AI slop.
