Truly handcrafted websites are becoming more and more scarce as tool technologies increase. With vibecoding, site builders, and the expectations brought along by corporations and the advent of Web3, static sites have become something of a lost artform.

It's easy to dig around Pinterest and social media and find an abundance of posts looking at pre-2020 websites, particularly pre-2015, the comment sections full of thoughts expressing sadness for websites losing their quirky charm. One comment in particular still sits with me: "when did the internet lose its personality :(".

Sure, there's an argument to be made that the internet hasn't lost it, or it never had one to begin with, but I think there's a more humanist answer. **The internet lost its personality when delegating imagination became standard.** When new tools and technologies come out, it's exciting to give them a try. "Look what this tool does!" can become a slippery slope towards "We no longer possess the skill to do this ourselves" when using the tool becomes the default.

You need a supercomputer to view the equivalent of what any computer could view then. Modern websites and web browsing are RAM-eating voids. The majority of websites I see these days are built using builders like [Squarespace](https://squarespace.com), [Framer](https://framer.com), and [Webflow](https://webflow.com), or JavaScript-based frameworks like [Next](https://nextjs.org) and [React](https://react.dev). It's resulting in [div hell](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=what+is+div+hell&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sei=IicSaZSxAfHD0PEP49as8A4), animation overkill, and a bloated internet that, when coupled with AI slop and cookie banners, is virtually unusable.

The cons of div hell are extensive and expanding: issues like poor accessibility, low SEO performance, site complexity and fragility, and bogged-down site loadtimes are becoming more and more common. In "bridging the gap" to make web design more readily accessible and "aesthetic" to the masses, we've created issues that lengthen the gap for others.

That said, this is creating new, unique opportunities for those looking for a return to older web practices. [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com)'s been seeing a renaissance (albeit a mobile-dominant renaissance, for those who grew up building custom desktop themes like I did). Sites like [Neocities](https://neocities.org) play on Geocities and offer a way to create your own digital home without complexity. Blogging platforms like [Bearblog](https://bearblog.dev) are doing the same for blogging.

It's refreshing to know that despite the direction the corporate internet is heading in, the ability to experience the old web is still out there, and the barrier to (re)entry is getting lower.

In short, the internet might have lost its personality, but **you have the power to bring it back**.
