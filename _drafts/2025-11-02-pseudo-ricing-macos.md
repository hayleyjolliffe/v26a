I do a lot of pseudo-ricing within MacOS, in particular, it's native apps, to achieve a level of genuine productivity that I can be satisfied with.

One of my favourite—and I believe most effective—customizations is utilizing MacOS's built-in window tiling feature to keep my interface divided into three core sections:

1. Left half
2. Top right corner
3. Bottom right corner

## Left Half

The left half of the screen is reserved for uses that are best supported by a larger screen footprint, typically for readability. Often, webpages and PDFs find their home on the left side of the screen.

## Top Right Corner

The top right corner is reserved exclusively for Obsidian. In the smaller tile, I keep the day's daily note open to take running notes as I work as a sort of inbox and triage procedure. Functionally, it's similar to [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de), but I prefer to keep all temporary notes contained to the daily note until the end of the day or the next morning, when they get moved to their new, permanent homes (if they get moved at all).

## Bottom Right Corner

The bottom right corner rotates depending on task and context. Typically during deep work blocks, you'll find VSCode open. During shallow work blocks, or when context-switching, you'll likely find my email, tasks, or calendar open (all Apple-native apps).

## Floaters

A few tinier tools float on top of whatever section is the most appropriate. Reminders and Terminal are both typically hiding in the background, or on top of an inactive section, as I prefer their small footprints and flexibility.

## Exceptions

Big-screen contexts are the most notable exceptions: large webpages that don't lend well to responsive, multi-person meetings (where I'm not sharing my screen), and creative tasks. Forcing Figma or DaVinci into a tiny window is a nightmare. When doing creative work, fullscreen will always get priority.

I've found that pairing this pseudo-ricing technique with greyscale mode has massively curbed getting pulled away by distractions. When I'm in the researching phase, it's easy to stray from the path by exploring too many topics/sources at once. Knowing that my digital home has a cohesive layout helps me to anticipate what is where, and it's been easier to stay focused.

Like with my personal [Inbox Zero]() protocols, I allow my workspace to take shape naturally based on the task at hand. I don't force it or approach it rigidly, as I find it creates unnecessary stress and my productivity promptly nosedives. I prefer *leveraging* the system over *enforcing* it.
